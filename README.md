# Minesweeper-logic_only
 This is a minesweeper solver written in python that can solve some cases that don't require any guesses

A "?" means an unkown space, which may or may not be a bomb.
A "." means an empty space, which as you may have guessed, doesn't contain anything.
A number tells you how many bombs are in the 8 spaces directly around the cell it is located in.

Note: this program is unable to solve situations where guessing is needed and will either crash or go into an infinite loop
